# momentum-abstract

## Get Started

```

### Usage

+ read core color token

```
const core = require('momentum-abstract/color/core.json');

+ In later chapters, we will describe in more detail how to use momentum-abstract.

## Naming convention

momentum uses a unified new naming convention to accommodate a variety of scalable scenarios. The common module of momentum-constructor provides the function of renaming elements so that some older systems can access momentum-abstract faster.
